# Java OOP Concepts Guide

This repository is a personal study guide and reference for understanding **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java. Each folder in this project contains focused examples, syntax, and explanations related to specific core concepts in Java programming. It’s organized to help learners, especially beginners, understand the foundations of Java OOP.

## 📂 Folder Overview

- **ABSTRACTCLAS** – Examples and syntax for abstract classes and methods.
- **ACCMODIFIERS** – Demonstrates access modifiers like `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default.
- **CONSTRUCTORS** – Covers constructors: default, parameterized, and overloading.
- **ENCAPSULATION** – Shows how encapsulation works using getters, setters, and private variables.
- **INHERITANCE** – Demonstrates inheritance: parent-child class relationships.
- **METHODS** – Contains examples of method creation, overloading, and usage.
- **MINI-ACTS** – Small activities or exercises related to Java OOP concepts.
- **OBJECTS-CLASSES** – Basic Java syntax for creating objects and classes.
- **PCKGEMODFIERS** – Explains package-level access and the use of package modifiers.
- **POLYMORPHISM** – Examples of compile-time and runtime polymorphism.
- **STATICMTD** – Illustrates static methods, variables, and usage.
- **SUPER** – Shows usage of `super` keyword to access parent class methods and constructors.

## ✅ Purpose

This repository is intended to:

- Serve as a **learning guide** for myself and others learning Java OOP.
- Provide **syntax reference** for each OOP concept.
- Help in **practice and review** for school or self-study.
