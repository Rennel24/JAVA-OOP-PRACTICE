# ☕ Java OOP Concepts Guide

This repository serves as a **personal study guide and reference** for understanding **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **Java**.
Each folder contains focused examples, syntax, and exercises covering specific OOP principles and related Java features.
It’s designed for **beginners and students** who want to strengthen their understanding of Java fundamentals through hands-on code exploration.

* **INHERITANCE** – Shows parent–child relationships and inheritance hierarchies.
* **POLYMORPHISM** – Covers method overriding and overloading for compile-time and runtime polymorphism.
* **ABSTRACTCLAS** – Examples of abstract classes and methods.
* **ABS-INTERFACE** – Illustrates interfaces, abstraction, and implementation.
* **SUPER** – Demonstrates the use of `super` to access parent class members and constructors.
* **THIS** – Examples showing how `this` keyword works in constructors and methods.
* **INSTANCEOF** – Demonstrates type checking with the `instanceof` operator.
