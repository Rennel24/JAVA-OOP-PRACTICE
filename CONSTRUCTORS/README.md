# Java Mini Projects & Syntax Guide

Welcome to my **Java** repository! This repo contains my mini projects and syntax experiments to help me fully understand and practice different Java concepts.

---

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders, each focusing on a specific Java topic or concept:

- **Constructor/**  
  Contains code examples and experiments to understand Java constructors deeply.

- *(You can add other folders like `Inheritance/`, `Loops/`, `Arrays/` etc. as you continue learning.)*

---

## How to Use This Repo

- Explore each folder to see code samples and mini projects.
- Run the Java files locally to experiment and learn.
- Use the syntax guides as a quick reference to Java programming concepts.

---

## Example: Constructor Folder

In the `Constructor/` folder, you'll find:

- Simple constructor examples
- Parameterized constructors
- Constructor overloading
- Practice projects demonstrating how constructors work in different scenarios

---

## Future Plans

- Add more topics and detailed explanations
- Include README files inside each folder for deeper documentation
- Upload Java projects that combine multiple concepts

---
